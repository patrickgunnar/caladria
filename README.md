1. Open prisma/schema.prisma.
2. Modify the provider field in the client block to your preferred database (e.g., postgresql, sqlite, etc.).
3. Update the DATABASE_URL in your .env file to match the new database connection string.
4. Run the Prisma migrations and db push to update the database schema

## Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or Ngrok URL with your browser to see the result.
