    - Run the following command to start ngrok and expose your local server:

```sh
    ngrok http 3000
```

3. Obtain the ngrok URL:
    - Copy the generated ngrok URL (e.g., https://"your-ngrok-id".ngrok.io).

### Set up webhooks:

-   **Clerk**: Go to your Clerk dashboard and set the webhook URL to https://"your-ngrok-id".ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk.
-   **Livekit**: Go to your Livekit dashboard and set the webhook URL to https://"your-ngrok-id".ngrok.io/api/webhooks/livekit.

-   **Livekit**: Required for live streaming capabilities. Sign up at Livekit and obtain the API URL, API key, API secret, and WebSocket URL.
-   **Uploadthing**: Used to store user thumbnails. Sign up at Uploadthing and obtain the secret and app ID.
-   **Clerk**: Handles authentication and user management. Sign up at Clerk and obtain the publishable key, secret key, and webhook secret.

## Setup the database

1. Ensure your MySQL database is running.
2. Update the DATABASE_URL in the .env file with your database credentials.
3. Run the Prisma migrations and db push to set up your database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
# then
npx prisma db push
```

**By default, this application uses MySQL as the database. You can change the database provider by updating the schema.prisma file in the prisma directory. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:**

1. Open prisma/schema.prisma.
2. Modify the provider field in the client block to your preferred database (e.g., postgresql, sqlite, etc.).
3. Update the DATABASE_URL in your .env file to match the new database connection string.
4. Run the Prisma migrations and db push to update the database schema

## Updating Next Configuration for Remote Image Patterns

To ensure your images are displayed correctly, you need to configure your URL in the Next.js settings. Follow these steps:

1. Open the next.config.mjs file:

    - Locate and open the next.config.mjs file in your project root directory.

2. Update the Remote Patterns:

    - Within the images section, find the remotePatterns array.

Add your hostname (URL) to the remotePatterns array as shown below:

```sh
module.exports = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        hostname: 'uploadthing domain',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

**Replace your-domain.com with your actual domain and adjust the pathname if necessary.**

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Run Caladria

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or Ngrok URL with your browser to see the result.
